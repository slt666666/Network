# Network
Sandbox for visualizing & analyzing Gene Network tools

## Distance_based_matrix
* visualize cluster based on distance between genes.
* visualize cluster based on phylogenetic distance between genes.
* (optional) add the other information about clade, expression...etc

## BarGraph
* visualize 1-dimentional dataset.
* which is the most conserved genes ?
* (optional) add the other information about clade, expression...etc.
